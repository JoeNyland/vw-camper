## About

I wanted to add automatic lights to my Lego VW Camper Van.

### Lighting Kit

I got the lighting kit for my VW Campec from Light My Bricks. The kit was really easy to install.
The lights are manually tuned on with a battery pack that sits on the back bench seat.

## Circuit

The lighting control circuit was my own creation. I prototyped a simple Aruduino project which reads
the current sunlight level from outside using an LDR and pull down resistor.

The Arduino board will serve as a power supply to the lights, so I did away with the battery pack
that's provided with the lighting kit.

## Program

If the sunlight level is within a predefined range, the program will turn the lights on in the camper
van. There's also a time constraint: the lights can only be turned on between 18:00 and 22:00 as
I don't want to waste energy lighting the camper when I'm not there to see it.
